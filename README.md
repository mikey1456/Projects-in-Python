This is my project page for projects invloving code in Python. 

I've seperated it into two parts, one for code in relation to school projects and another for side projects I do in my free-time.


                                                                              School Projects:

1. First Year:
   - Programming Laboratory
   - Programming Project

   
2. Second Year:
   - Computational Mathematics

   
3. Third Year:
   - Third Year Project (Python Implementation Only)



                                                                                Side Projects:



     
1. Scientific Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science:
   - Mathematical and Statistical Simulations
   - Machine Learning, Deep Learning and other aspects of Artificial Intelligence
   - Computational Finance
   - Computational Physics



2. Cyber & Information Security:
   - Encryption and Decryption Algorithms
   - Simulating different cyber-attacks
   - Creating APIs
